4.3 Mutexes and Monitors
========================

Data Races
----------

- Sharing data between threads can cause issues
- This can be resolved by using a lock to gain exclusive access

Mutual Exclusion Lock
---------------------

- Provided by the OS
- Commonly known as a mutex

Mutex POSIX API
---------------

States
------

- Locked (held by some thread)
- Unlocked (not held by any thread)

Unlock Operation
----------------

- Only allowed when the mutex is locked
- Returns immediately

Lock Operation
--------------

- Allowed on locked and unlocked mutexes
- May force the caller to wait until the lock is unlocked by another thread

```c
pthread_mutex_t my_mutex;
pthread_mutex_init(&my_mutex, 0);
pthread_mutex_lock(&my_mutex);
// operate on the protected data structure
pthread_mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);
// destroy when done
pthread_mutex_destroy(&my_mutex);
```
