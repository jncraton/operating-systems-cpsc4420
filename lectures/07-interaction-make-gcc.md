1.7 Supporting Interactions Across Time
=======================================

Storage
-------

- OS provides long-term storage for computation results
- Results can be retrieved for future computations

File system
-----------

- Named persistent storage
- Typically organized in a hierarchy

File access
-----------

- Accessed via OS APIs (`read`, `write`)
- May be mapped to memory space and accessed directly with `load` and `store`

Databases
---------

- Provide persistent storage
- Allows related data to be access easily

---

What if the system goes down during a write?

Crashes
-------

- Any operation should be immediately interruptable without leaving persistent storage in a degraded state
- Atomic transactions and journaling may be a solution to this

1.8 Supporting Interactions Across Space
========================================

Networking
----------

- Provides a means for separate systems to interact
- Network stack organized into layers

Sockets
-------

- Provides a standard and consistent API for applications to use for networking
- Supports streaming and packet-based communication

Socket types
------------

- Stream - provides a virtual circuit
- Datagram - delivers individual packets

Socket Implementation
---------------------

- Independent of network type
- Most typically used with TCP/IP and UDP/IP

---

```c
if((sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) < 0) {
  return 1;
}

if( connect(sockfd, &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {
  return 1;
}

if (n = read(sockfd, recvBuff, sizeof(recvBuff)-1)) <= 0) {
  return 1;
}

printf("%s\n", recvBuff);
```

1.9 Security
============

Threats
-------

- Operating systems need to be able to behave correctly in the face of malicious actors

Objectives
----------

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Accountability
