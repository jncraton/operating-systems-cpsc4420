2 Threads
=========

2.1 Introduction to Threads
===========================

Thread
------

- A sequence of computational instructions run one after another

Single-threaded Programs
------------------------

- Simple programs typically have only one thread
- Many programs you have written fall into this category
- They are easy to reason about and understand

Multi-threaded Programs
-----------------------

- Contain multiple threads of execution
- Are suitable for parallel processing tasks
- Make effective use of modern computer architectures

Programs and Threads
--------------------

- Programs are a collection of instructions
- A thread is a collection of instructions being executed
- Every running program has at least one thread

---

Process
-------

- Most operating systems implement a container to hold threads
- This container is called a process

Lifetime
--------

- Threads exist from the time their first instruction begins executing until the time of last instruction execution
- Threads with overlapping lifetimes are running concurrently
- A key feature of most operating systems is allow threads to run concurrently

2.3 Reasons for Concurrent Threads
==================================

---

Why is it desirable for the computer to execute multiple threads concurrently, rather than waiting for one to finish before starting another?

Responsiveness
--------------

- Allows rapid response to input even while working on other computations
- This is demonstrated by the example as both threads can respond to a timer

Resource Utilization
--------------------

- The computer has many hardware resources (CPU, memory, disks, etc)
- We want use all of these resources efficiently
- We need to be able to pause a thread waiting on I/O to allow the CPU to be used for other tasks

Modularization
-------------

- We may also like threads for creating cleaner programs
- Aspects of computation can be handle independently

Web Server Example
------------------

- What does a web server do?
- How might threads help?

Multiprocessor Example
----------------------

- Nearly all systems now have multiple processors
- How are threads useful here
