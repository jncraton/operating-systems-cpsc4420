1.3 Middleware
==============

Middleware
----------

- Middleware is software that sits between application programs and the operating system
- Databases, J2EE

1.5 Multiple Computations on One Computer
=========================================

Resources
---------

- Limted CPU time, disk access bandwidth, memory bandwidth
- Multiple application using resources simultaneously

Concurrency
-----------

- Make efficient use of resources
- When we aren't actively using the CPU because we are waiting on I/O, another program can use it

Thread
------

- Fundamental unit of concurrency
- Sequence of programmed actions
- Each program includes at least one thread

Process
-------

- Container for one or more threads
- Protects threads from interactions from unrelated threads running on the same computer
- Threads in different process do not share memory

Thread APIs
-----------

- Create 
- Kill
- Switch

Scheduling
----------

- OS will have many threads that can be run
- Limited CPUs are available
- OS must select thread to run

1.6 Controlling Interactions Between Computations
=================================================

Dependencies
------------

- Sometimes threads are not fully independent
- One thread may generate data that another consumes
- These threads need to interact via *syncronization*

---

What if thread A is waiting for thread B and thread B is waiting for thread A?

Deadlock
--------

- Cyclic waiting
- Must be addressed to prevent freezes
- Difficult to solve generally

Transaction
-----------

- Unit of computation with no externally visible internal state
- Computation succeeds for fails as a unit
- Useful concurrency primative

Accidental Interaction
----------------------

- Threads share memory, so they may interact unintentionally
- This can be mitigated on some systems using virtual memory

1.7 Supporting Interactions Across Time
=======================================

Storage
-------

- OS provides long-term storage for computation results
- Results can be retrieved for future computations

File system
-----------

- Named persistent storage
- Typically organized in a hierarchy

File access
-----------

- Accessed via OS APIs (`read`, `write`)
- May be mapped to memory space and accessed directly with `load` and `store`

Databases
---------

- Provide persistent storage
- Allows related data to be access easily

Crashes
-------

- Any operation should be immediately interruptable without leaving persistent storage in a degraded state
- Atomic transactions and journaling may be a solution to this
