6.2 Uses for Virtual Memory
===========================

Memory Protection
-----------------

- Shared memory creates concurrency challenges
- What if each thread had private memory?

Virtual Memory
--------------

- Provides memory privacy
- Can also be repurposed for many other uses

Addressing
----------

- Addresses are used to look up memory locations
- Virtual memory decouples addresses that programs use to identify memory from physical memory locations
- Virtual addresses are used by software
- Physical addresses are real locations in hardware

Address Mapping
---------------

- Load and store operations are given virtual addresses
- Memory management unit (MMU) is used to translate addresses

Virtual Memory Properties
-------------------------

- Virtual to physical mapping stored in a table to be general and configurable
- To keep table size manageable, addresses are grouped into pages
- Table contents are controlled by OS
- Table can be sparse. Undefined pages are illegal to use (page fault).
- Pages may have more granular permission (R/W)

Uses
----

- Private storage
- Controlled sharing
- Flexible allocation
- Sparse address spaces
- Persistence
- Demand-driven loading
- Efficient zero filling
- Substituting disk for RAM

Private Storage
---------------

- Each computation should be able to use whatever virtual addresses it finds most convenient for its objects, without needing to avoid using the same address as some other computation
- Each computationâ€™s objects should be protected from accidental (or malicious) access by other computations

Process
-------

- Group of one or more threads in a protection context
- Protection context is a broad idea. For now, it means an isolated virtual address space

Controlled Sharing
------------------

- Certain memory areas can be shared by multiple processes
- Can facilitate communication
- Can reduce memory usage
