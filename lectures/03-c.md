# C

## Scope

- Provides lexical scope to eliminate global variables
- Functions exist in global namespace
- Functions may not be declared within other functions

## Typing

- Variable are statically typed
- Type rules are weakly enforced
- Implicit conversions are possible

## Running C Programs

- Compile to executable: `gcc source.c --output executable`
- Run the executable: `./executable`
- `tcc` can run C compile and run in one step: `tcc -run source.c`

```c
int a = 1;
float b = 2.0;

printf("%f\n", a + b); // Prints 3.0
```

```c
char * a = 1;
int b = 2;

printf("%d\n", a + b); // Prints 3
```
