Course Catalog Description
--------------------------

This course focuses on the fundamentals of operating systems (OS), including how the OS manages processes,
memory, I/O, and file management. Process and thread management are emphasized, including synchronization,
communication, races, and deadlocks. Virtual memory, virtualization/hypervisors, and disk management are also
discussed. With each topic, the security implications and design considerations are thoroughly discussed.
PREREQUISITE: CPSC 2420 and CPSC 2500.

Required Resources
------------------

- [Operating Systems and Middleware (Free)](https://gustavus.edu/mcs/max/os-book/)
- [ISO C Standard (Draft is free)](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf)
- [C Programming (Free)](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming)

Course objectives
-----------------

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Describe low level operating system concepts, including kernel mode vs. user mode and the roles of the
CPU, memory, busses, I/O and other hardware concepts.
- Write programs using the C language to create new processes and perform interprocess communication.
- Write C programs to utilize parallelism, including thread creation and interthread communication.
- Identify race conditions, and describe how to use mutual exclusion, semaphores, mutexes, and condition
variables to address this issue.
- Describe classical interprocess communication problems, including the Producer-Consumer problem, the
Dining Philosopher problem, and the Readers and Writers problem.
- Identify the operating system's role in scheduling processes and threads, including common scheduling
algorithms.
- Describe memory abstractions, including base and limit registers, swapping, and virtual memory.
- Examine the operating system's role in memory management, including the function of multi-level caching,
the MMU, and the TLB.
- Describe common file system structures, and the operating system's role in file system management.
- Implement programs in C which explore issues in memory management and/or file system management.

Course Overview
---------------

Please refer to Canvas for a list of assignments and detailed grading breakdown.

### Presentations

Students will complete a  presentation sharing knowledge of a specific operating system of interest with their peers.

### Labs

Students will complete regular labs using various technologies. Labs that include code that does not compile or parse correctly will be given zero credit.

### Quizzes and Homework

Regular quizzes will be given covering the lecture material. Students will have two attempts on each quiz, one at the start of class and one at the end. Only the highest score will be kept. The lowest score from the semester will not count toward the final grade. Students will also complete homework assignments covering various topics from the course text.

### Exams

A total of 3 exams will be taken in this course. All exams are cumulative with a focus on more recent material.

Grading Scale
-------------

The following standard grading scale is used to map percentages to letter grades:

| Letter Grade | Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| A | 93-100% |
| A- | 90-93% |
| B+ | 87-90% |
| B | 83-87% |
| B- | 80-83% |
| C+ | 77-80% |
| C | 73-77% |
| C- | 70-73% |
| D+ | 67-70% |
| D | 63-67% |
| D- | 60-63% |
| F | 0-60% |

Late Assignments
----------------

Late assignments will lose 10% for each day they are late rounded up, so an assignment submitted even one second late may be deducted 10%.

Anderson University Educational Commitment
------------------------------------------

veritas - fidelitas - utilitas

> The mission of Anderson University is to educate for a life of faith and service in the church and society. Across the curriculum students can expect faculty to guide learning experiences toward the development of excellence, integrity, servant leadership, responsibility, and generosity.
>
> As a student of the university you are expected to fully engage in vigorous intellectual and experiential activity where head, heart, and hands are equally engaged and a commitment to Christ is honored.

Academic Honesty
----------------

As an institution of higher education committed to academic and Christian discovery, Anderson University expects faculty and students alike to maintain the highest standards of academic and personal integrity. "Anderson University seeks to support and promote qualities of academic honesty and personal integrity and regards cheating, plagiarism, and all other forms of academic dishonesty as serious offenses against the University community" (Faculty Handbook 4.23 Policy on Academic Integrity). See the [Student Handbook](https://anderson.edu/student-life/handbook/) for examples of plagiarism.

Generative AI
-------------

The use of [generative artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) tools must adhere to ethical standards and uphold academic integrity. While AI tools can be useful for coding assistance, they should not replace the learning experience of practicing coding skills. Therefore, excessive reliance on such tools without proper understanding shall be considered academic dishonesty.

In general, [intelligent code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion) and utilizing large language models to aid in programming problems is appropriate on lab assignments. However, students must demonstrate comprehension and ownership of their submitted work. If a student cannot fully understand or explain their code, they should not submit it as their own.

It is important to recognize that professional software development often involves collaboration and leveraging various resources, including AI tools. Nevertheless, each contributor is responsible for ensuring the quality and accuracy of their contributions. Students must take full responsibility for their submitted work, regardless of whether parts were generated by AI models.

Academic Support Statements
---------------------------

### Accessibility and Accommodations

Important: If you have any special accessibility needs (i.e. use of screen reading software, captioning, etc.), please notify your professor and the Director of Student Accessibility Services (Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence, Nicholson Library; 765-641-4223) as soon as possible.

If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, you are encouraged to contact the Director of Student Accessibility Services (Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence, Nicholson Library; 765-641-4223). To receive reasonable accommodations, you must contact Student Accessibility Services, provide documentation, and request accommodations. You should also notify your course instructor during the first week of classes.

### Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence

The [Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence (KACE)](https://anderson.edu/kissinger/services/), located on the ground floor of the Nicholson Library, provides excellent resources in all areas of study regardless of academic ability. Many students can benefit from academic support and/or sharpen their skills through studying with others. In addition, excellent students often maintain their skills by working as peer tutors. The services are available for all enrolled students at no charge. For information, call 765-641-4225.

Attendance Policy
-----------------

Class attendance is fundamental to the teaching/learning process and any absence from a class results in a loss of learning for the student and learning community. It is the student's obligation to personally notify the course instructor about any absence, in advance if possible. Students may be directly penalized only after the number of absences exceeds the number of class meeting hours per week. Where a student misses more than the number of classes stated above, or additional absences as may be allotted by the course instructor, the instructor has the discretion to determine whether missed work may be completed, how much work will be evaluated, and consequences of excessive absences.

Pathways Program
----------------

Anderson University has a robust referral system that was created to connect students with the campus resources that will be most beneficial to them. Students may be referred by faculty for any student success issue. Students will be contacted by an appropriate staff or faculty member to provide support and care.
